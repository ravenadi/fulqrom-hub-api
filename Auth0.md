⏺ Great question! Let me explain why you need separate Client IDs.

  The Problem: Two Incompatible Use Cases

  Your backend .env file has ONE AUTH0_CLIENT_ID that's being used for TWO different purposes:

  1. Frontend Login (Authorization Code Flow)

  - Used by: Your React app in the browser
  - Flow: Authorization Code with PKCE
  - Requires: Token Endpoint Auth Method = "None"
  - Why: Browser cannot securely store secrets
  - Grant Types Needed: Authorization Code, Refresh Token, Implicit

  2. Backend Management API (Client Credentials Flow)

  - Used by: Your Node.js API server
  - Flow: Client Credentials (Machine-to-Machine)
  - Requires: Token Endpoint Auth Method = "Post" or "Basic"
  - Why: Server can securely store secrets
  - Grant Types Needed: Client Credentials

  The Conflict

  You can't have both because:
  - Token Endpoint Auth Method can only be one value
  - Setting it to "Post" breaks frontend login ❌
  - Setting it to "None" breaks Management API ❌

  The Solution: Two Applications, Two Client IDs

  Backend .env file needs TWO variables:
  ├── AUTH0_FRONTEND_CLIENT_ID (for browser login)    ← New SPA application
  └── AUTH0_CLIENT_ID (for Management API)            ← Your current M2M app

  How It Works

  Backend API (/auth/config endpoint - line 570-577)

  router.get('/config', (req, res) => {
    res.json({
      clientId: process.env.AUTH0_FRONTEND_CLIENT_ID,  // ← SPA client ID for frontend
      // ... other config
    });
  });

  Backend Auth0 Service (auth0Service.js)

  const management = new ManagementClient({
    clientId: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,  // ← M2M client ID for Management API
    clientSecret: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
    // ...
  });

  Quick Setup

  Do you want me to:
  1. Create a new SPA application in Auth0 for you (I can guide you)
  2. Update the backend /auth/config endpoint to use a separate frontend client ID
  3. Add the new environment variable to your .env

  This will fix both issues:
  - ✅ Frontend login will work
  - ✅ Backend user creation will work
