feat: Add permission-based filtering to audit logs

Implemented comprehensive role and resource-based permission filtering
for the Activity Timeline (Audit Logs) to ensure users only see activities
for resources they have explicit access to.

BREAKING: None - Fully backward compatible
SECURITY: Critical fixes - Prevents unauthorized data access

Critical Bugs Fixed:
1. Users could see activities without proper role permission
2. Users with role permissions couldn't see ALL activities when
   resource_access existed for other module types

Key Changes:
- Add permission filtering to GET /api/audit-logs endpoint
- Add permission filtering to GET /api/audit-logs/stats endpoint
- Add resource-specific ID fields to audit log response
- Fix per-module resource restriction logic
- Increase rate limit from 100 to 1000 requests/15min for development

Permission Logic (Per Module):
- If user has role permission + resource_access for module: Show ONLY those resources
- If user has role permission + NO resource_access: Show ALL resources
- If user has NO role permission: Block all activities (even with resource_access)
- Super Admin & Admin: Bypass all filters

Files Modified:
- routes/auditLogs.js - Core implementation
- middleware/rateLimiter.js - Rate limit increase

Files Added:
- CHANGELOG_AUDIT_LOGS.md - Release notes
- PRODUCTION_RELEASE_SUMMARY.md - Deployment guide
- docs/AUDIT_LOGS_PERMISSIONS.md - Implementation guide
- docs/AUDIT_LOGS_PERMISSION_FIX.md - Verification guide

Test Coverage:
✅ Super Admin access
✅ Admin role access
✅ Role-based module permissions
✅ Resource-specific permissions (customer, site, building, floor, asset)
✅ Document category/discipline filtering
✅ Permission denial for unauthorized access
